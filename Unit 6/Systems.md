# Vocab
- `System`: a graph with at least $2$ lines
- `Solution`: where the lines in a `system` intersect
- `Coinside`: occupy the same space

# Types of Systems
- `Consistent`: at least one `solution`
	- `Independant`: only one `solution`; Lines have *different* **slope**
	- `Dependant`: infinite `solutions`; Lines have *same* **slope** *and* **y-intercept**
- `Inconsistent`: no `solutions`; Lines have the *same* **slope**, but *different* **y-intercept**

# Notes
- `Consistent-Independant Systems` consist of lines that are *not* **parallel**
- `Consistent-Dependant Systems` consist of lines that `coincide` or are the **same**
- `Inconsistent Systems` consist of **parallel** lines
