# Vocab
- `Sequence`: an ordered set of numbers
	- `Geometric Sequence`: a `sequence` in which the ratio between consecutive terms is constant
		- `Common Ratio`: the ratio of a term to its previous term in a `geometric sequence`
		- `Geometric Series`: the sum of the terms of a `geometric sequence`
		- `Recursive Formula`: the formula to find the next term in a `geometric sequence` using the preceding term or terms
		- `Function Formula`: the formula to directly find any item in a `geometric sequence`
		- `Series Formula`: the formula to find the sum of all items in a `geometric sequence` up to an index $n$

# Formulae
Where $a$ is a `geometric sequence`, $r$ is $a$'s `common ratio`, and $n$ is an index of $a$
- `Recursive Formula`: $a_n = a_{n-1}r$
- `Function Formula`: $a_n = a_1r^{n-1}$
- `Series Formula`: $s = a_1\frac{1-r^n}{1-r}$ where $s$ is the sum
