# Vocab
-  `Asymptote`: a line that a graphed curve gets *closer* **to**, but *never* **touches** as the variable approaches -$\infin$ or $\infin$
- `Exponential Function`: a function in the form of $f(x)=ab^x$, where $a \ne 0$, $b>0$, and $b \ne 1$
	- $b$: the base of the function which determines its **shape** and **direction**; $b>1$, `exponential growth`; $0<b<1$, `exponential decay`
	- $a$: the **y-intercept** of the function
- `Exponential Decay`: the ***decrease*** in number or size of a system at an increasingly rapid rate in proportion to itself
- `Exponential Growth`: the ***increase*** in number or size of a system at an increasingly rapid rate in proportion to itself
- `Domain`: the set of all **x-values** given to a function
- `Range`: the set of all **y-values** described by a function
