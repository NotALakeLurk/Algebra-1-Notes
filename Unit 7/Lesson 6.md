# Vocab
- `Principal`: the original amount of money that is borrowed or invested
- `Simple Interest`: interest paid or earned on the `principal`
- `Compound Interest`: interest earned or paid based on both the `principal` and previously paid interest
- `Depreciation`: the exponential decrease of the value of a purchased product
- `Radioactive Decay`: the changing of a radioactive substance into another
	- `Half-life`: the amount of time required for one half of a radioactive substance to decay

# Equations
Where $t$ is time, $r$ is the rate per unit of $t$, and $a$ is the starting value or principal
- `Exponential Growth`: $ y=a(1+r)^t $
	- `Compound Interest`: $ y=a(1+\frac{r}{n})^{nt} $, where $n$ is the amount of compounds per unit of $t$
- `Exponential Decay`: $ y=a(1-r)^t $
	- `Radioactive Decay`: $ y=a(0.5)^{\frac{t}{h}} $, where $h$ is the radioactive `half-life` in units of $t$
