# Vocab
- `Quadratic Trinomial`: a trinomial in the form of $x^2 + bx \pm c$ with a degree of $2$

# Notes
- Multiplying two binomials with degrees of $1$ results in a `quadratic trinomial`

# Factoring Quadratic Trinomials with a Leading Coefficient of $1$
1. Write two sets of parenthesis with $+$ s; if the second term of the trinomial is negative, flip both signs; then, if the last term is negative, flip the $2^{nd}$ sign again
2. Write the root of the first term in each
3. Factor the last term and find the factors who's sum is the coefficient of the $2^{nd}$ term
4. Use the factors as the $2^{nd}$ terms of the binomials

## Example
$$
	x^2 -7x -18
$$

1. $(-)(+)$
2. $(x -)(x +)$
3. 
	- $-18 = 2 \times -9$
	- $-7 = 2 - 9$
4. $(x-9)(x+2)$
