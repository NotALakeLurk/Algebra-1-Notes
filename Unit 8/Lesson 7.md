# Factoring Quadraic Trinomials with a Leading Coefficient Greater Than $1$
1. Factor out the GCF of all three terms
2. Find and factor the product of the first and last terms
3. Find the factors who's sum is the middle term and substitute them in
4. Factor by grouping

## Example
$$ 6x^2 + 14x + 4 $$

1. $ 2(3x^2 + 7x + 2) $
2. $ 3x^2 \times 2 = 6x^2 = 3x \times 2x $
3. $ 2(3x^2+3x+2x+2) $
4. 
	- $ 2(3x(x+1)+2(x+1)) $
	- $ 2(3x+2)(x+1) $
	- $ (3x+2)(2x+2) $
