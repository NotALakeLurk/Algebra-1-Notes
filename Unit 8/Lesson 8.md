# Vocab
- `Perfect Square`: any number who's positive square root is a whole number
- `Perfect Square Trinomial`: a trinomial who's first and last terms are `perfect squares`, and who's middle term is twice the product of the roots of the outer terms

# Notes
- Each term in a differnce of two squares is a perfect square; the factors will be two binomials, usually the sum of the roots, and the difference of the roots (? Yeah, they're squares, of course they're perfect)
