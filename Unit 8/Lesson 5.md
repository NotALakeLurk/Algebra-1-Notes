# Vocab
- `Factors`: numbers that can be multiplied together to find a product
- `Factor`: to express a value as a product of two or more `factors`
- `Common Factors`: `factors` that are shared by two or more numbers
- `GCF` (Greatest Common Factor): the `common factor` with the greatest value
- `Prime Number`: a number that has only itself and $1$ as factors (not including $1$)
- `Prime Factors`: `factors` that are only prime
- `Prime Factorization`: representation of a number as a product of `prime factors`

- `Zero Product Property`: where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers: $ab=0 \implies a=0$ or $b=0$
- `Roots`: the solution sets that make an equation true

# Factoring

## With GCF
1. `Prime factorize` each term
2. Mark `common factors` and multiply to find the `GCF`
3. Write each term using the `GCF` to `factor`
4. Use the distributive property to `factor` out the `GCF`

### Example
$$
	2x^2-4x
$$

1. $2x^2 = 2 \times x \times x \\ 4x = 2 \times 2 \times x$
2. $2 \times x = 2x$
3. $x(2x)-2(2x)$
4. $2x(x-2)$

## By Grouping
1. `Prime Factorize` each term
2. Mark `common factors` in groups
3. `Factor` out `GFC` from terms
4. Distribute

### Example
$$
	7x^3-21x^2+5x-15
$$

1. $7x^3 = 7 \times x \times x \times x \\ 21x^2 = 7 \times 3 \times x \times x \\ 5x = 5 \times x \\ 15 = 5 \times 3$
2. $7x^3, 21x^2 = 7 \times x \times x \\ 5x, 15 = 5$
3. $7x^2(x-3) + 5(x-3)$
4. $(7x^2+5)(x-3)$

## Solve Polynomial Equations by Factoring
1. `Factor`
2. Apply `zero product property`
3. Solve each equation to get the set of roots

### Example
$$
	5x^2-x=0
$$

1. $x(5x-1)=0$
2. $x=0$ or $5x-1=0$
3. $x\in\{0, \frac{1}{5}\}$
