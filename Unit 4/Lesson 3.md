# Vocab
- `Standard Form` (linear(?)): variables on the left and constants on the right
- `Ellipsis`: the series of $3$ dots at the end of a number sequence that indicates that the sequence continues in the same manner (...)
- `Sequence`: a set of numbers with a specific pattern
- `Arithmetic Sequence`: a sequence of numbers in which the difference between each term is the same non-zero number (similar to geometric sequences)
- `Common Difference`: the difference between each term in an `aritmetic sequence`

# Notes
- $n^{th}$ term of an `arithmatic sequence`: $a_n = a_1 + d(n-1)$ where $d$ is the common difference
