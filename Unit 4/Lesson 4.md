# Vocab
- `Constant of Variation`: the value that relates two variables that are directly or inversely proportional to each other; $k$
- `Direct Variation`: a relationship between variables who's ratio remains a non-zero constant, because if one variable increases, the other variable increases in proportion; $y=kx$ or $k\in\{\frac{y}{x}, \frac{x}{y}\}$
- `Inverse Variation`: a relationship in which the product of the values of the variables remains a non-zero constant, because if one variable increases, the other decreases in porportion; $y=\frac{k}{x}$ or $k=xy$
