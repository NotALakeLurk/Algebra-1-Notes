# Vocab
- `Indirect Measurement`: any method that uses formulas, figures, or `proportions` to measure something
- `Ratio`: a comparison of two similar quantities using division
	- `Rate`: the `ratio` of the amount of change of one quantity relative to another
		- `Unit Rate`: a `rate` in which the second quantity is written as one unit
- `Proportion`: an equation stating that two `ratios` are equal
	- `Means and Extremes`: the terms that are opposite each other across the division symbol in a `proportion`; $ \frac{e_1}{m_1} = \frac{m_2}{e_2} $

# Notes
- In a `proportion` the product of the means is equal to the product of the extremes: $ {m_1 \times m_2} = {e_1 \times e_2} $
