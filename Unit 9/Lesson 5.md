# Vocab
- `Roots` (Functions): the solutions or zeros of a function / where the graph touches the x-axis
- `Interecpt Form` (Quadratic Function): $f(x)=a(x-s)(x-p)$ where $s$ and $p$ are the x-coordinates of the roots; (Useful for real life)

# Notes
- `Intercept Form`: $a$ can be found by substituting the x-component of the vertex as $x$
