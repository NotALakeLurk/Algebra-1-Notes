# Vocab
- `Vertex Form` (Quadratic Function): a quadratic function in the form of $ f(x) = a(bx-h)^2+k $
- `Dilation` (Quadratic Function): a transformation resulting in a parabola that is wider or narrower than the original
- `Reflection` (Quadratic Function): a transformation resulting in a paragola that opens in the opposite direction as the original
- `Translation` (Quadratic Function): a transformation resulting in a parabola that is shifted (directionally) compared to the original

# Notes
- `Vertex Form`: the vertex is $ (\frac{h}{b}, k) $
	- $h$ `translates` the parabola horizontally
	- $k$ `translates` the parabola vertically 
- Every quadratic function is a trasform of $ f(x)=x^2 $
- $c$ `translates` the parabola vertically
- $a$ `dilates` the parabola vertically
	- $0<a<1$: compression
	- $a>1$: stretch
	- changing the sign of $a$ `reflects` the parabola
- $b$ `dilates` the parabola horizontally
	- $0<b<1$: stretch
	- $b>1$: compression
